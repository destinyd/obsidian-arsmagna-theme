# Ars Magna theme for Obsidian

_The World is bound with Secret Knots  -- A. Kircher_

A theme for Obsidian that is a synthesis of lots of other people's work, as is fitting. Originally based on [deathau's](https://github.com/deathau) Notation theme, incorporating his and [cotemaxime's) · GitHub](https://github.com/cotemaxime) work on [Andy Matuschak mode](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/andy-matuschak-mode-v2-7-updated-for-0-7-new-panes/170), plus a few other things that I wanted. Works equally well in lucis or umbra modes.

## Install

1. Download obsidian.css to your Obsidian vault folder.
2. In Obsidian, click _Settings_ → _Plugins_ and turn on "Custom CSS".
